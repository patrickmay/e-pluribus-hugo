Here are the results of my implementation of EPH on the 1984 data.  As
a side effect, my code found several duplicate ballots (voters 1444,
4112, and 4554) which changed the total ballot count in a few
categories slightly from those
[provided by P J Evans](http://nielsenhayden.com/makinglight/archives/016283.html#4176445).
